🏏 IPL Score & Win/Loss Percentage Prediction

This project is a prototype machine learning model that predicts:
IPL match scores
Win/Loss percentage for teams
based on historical IPL match data and team statistics.
The goal of this project is to provide insights into match outcomes and help cricket enthusiasts, analysts, or teams make data-driven predictions.

📌 Features

Predicts team scores based on match conditions
Estimates win/loss probabilities for IPL teams
Built with Python using popular ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
Prototype-level model: Designed for demonstration, analysis, and learning

🛠️ How It Works

Data Collection: Historical IPL match data, including:
Runs scored
Wickets taken
Overs played
Venue statistics
Team performance metrics

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning missing values
Encoding categorical data
Normalizing numeric features

Model Training:
Regression models for score prediction
Classification models for win/loss prediction
Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, and F1 Score

Prediction:
Input team details, opponent, venue, and match conditions
Output predicted score and win/loss probability
